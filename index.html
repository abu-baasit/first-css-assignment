    <h1>Welcome to CSS</h1>
    <p>In a bid to learn CSS an assignment was given by the major hub CapacityBay to test the ability of their student.After we learnt HTML we move to learn new things that will be beneficial.I tried as much as possible to stay active on the learning platform in other to achieve so many things.Being a developer is wonderful and what astonish me is knowing the rudiments i.e know what goes behind the seen and and being able to analize what is the information is all about.
        Learning is very important in the life of human being.Its better to be called a knowledgeable person than to be called an ignoramous.When studying there is need to be patient and have strong conviction on whatever we are learning and practisind as well.A word is enough for the wise.<br>
       Knowledge brings one out of darkness,that is why people say knowledge is light due to its usefulness,on the other side ignorance is darkness it makes life difficult for whomsoever that thread the path.So therefore choose the right and meaning path.
